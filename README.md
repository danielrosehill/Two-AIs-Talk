# AI Agent Meets AI Agent

 ![alt text](screenshots/image.png)

 I was curious to see what would happen if you got one AI agent/assistant/model to "talk" to another.

 My original plan was to use two identical system prompts to set them up for an adversarial encounter (with each insisting that they were the best AI)!

 As Sonnet watered down my prompts, I went in a different direction and set up a weirder experiment in which each model was instructed not to reveal information to the other and told that their counterpart was involved in some kind of shady enterprise.
